# scala-adventures
In general you should complete the exercises in the master branch.
There is a solution branch with  ... guess what...

Choose your adventure below


##Adventure 1 : Handling Errors with Monads
The aim is:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> cats
1. Gain practice/confidence in handling errors.
2. Gain practice weilding monads (all the exercises can be solved using generic monad or applicative functor methods!).

Complete the exercises in: com.rea.error.ErrorExercises

There are a series of tests that you need to make pass in ErrorExercisesSpec.
Run them with `./sbt test`


### Using scalaz disjunction to handle errors

We can represent the result of a function that may give us an error as "either an error or a result".
We choose to use the scalaz "Disjunction" class to hold this result type.  
Disjunction is similar to the scala "Either" but is "right-biased".  This means it forms a monad, which
gives us all the richness of monad transformers and combinators to help us work with our errors.  It is also 
an applicative functor, which gives us additional methods (sequence / transform).

In these exercises we first define `AppError` : a case class to hold our errors.
Then we define a type alias `ErrorOr[A]`, that represents our return type of "Either an error or a result".

We then practice creating, combining and transforming our results.

##Adventure 2 : Encoding Json with Argonaut

The aim is:
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

>>>>>>> cats
1. Gain practice/confidence in encoding using the argonaut library
2. Gain an understanding of how argonaut is doing this.
